- `ACCESS_TOKEN` - Twitter access token
- `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` - Twitter access token secret
- `GOTWI_API_KEY` - Twitter API key

- `GIT_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Git access token for the bot
- `LYRICS_REPOSITORY` - Git repository URL where the lyrics are stored

The lyrics repository is expected to contain a directory named `lyrics` containing all lyrics as individual files, with or without subdirectories.
Each lyric file is expected to begin with a line following the format `[Artist]Ôºè[Song title]`
